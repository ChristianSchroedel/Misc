 
Things we should implement next Time:

- Game Object moves to way point
- Write test For MoveToWayPoint
- GameObject can be clicked and send from user to way point
- Handling of user input in seperate controller class
- Control inputs for movement via mouse and/or keyboard
- There Are GameObjects like walls etc., that act like a barrier for the game object > better game object implementation
